Title: **Warehouse Wreckage**

Description:
In this Unreal Engine project titled "Warehouse Wreckage," I developed a scene that showcases the basic physics capabilities of Unreal Engine through an engaging, interactive environment. The scene allows the player to utilize a shooting mechanism to launch black balls into a room filled with various objects, effectively demonstrating the collision and destruction of these items.

Key Features:
- **Interactive Shooting Mechanism**: The player can shoot black balls at different objects within the room, observing how the impact and force interact with the environment.
- **Blueprint Implementation**: The entire project is implemented using Unreal Engine's Blueprints, ensuring an accessible and maintainable approach for developing and managing the game logic.
- **Projectile Spawning and Impulse**: Functions for spawning projectiles and applying impulse to them are included in the scene. This allows for precise control over the force and direction of the projectile upon release.
- **Realistic Physics**: The project demonstrates the physics engine's capabilities in Unreal Engine, allowing objects to be knocked over and interact with each other in a realistic manner.

Technical Details:
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine
- **Development Approach**: Blueprint scripting
- **Physics Engine**: Utilizes Unreal Engine's physics engine for realistic interaction and destruction
- **Scene Design**: Thoughtfully arranged room with various objects for optimal demonstration of physics effects

Overall, "Warehouse Wreckage" is a visually engaging and technically sound scene that effectively highlights the physics capabilities of Unreal Engine through interactive gameplay. By employing Blueprints for development, I created a clear and user-friendly demonstration of object interaction, collision, and destruction within a game environment. This project serves as a testament to my ability to design and implement physics-based scenes in Unreal Engine, offering a unique and immersive experience for players.
